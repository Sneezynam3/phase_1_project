<!-- 
My project is about another project of mine. Similarly, to learning to code, I have also been working on restoring a classic car for several years now. My project’s focal point is the taillights of my car using mouse play. To start, mouse over the single image displayed on the DOM. The images cycle through the restoration process. Take the mouse off the image and the most complete image of the taillights is displayed. If you click the image an ordered list will provide some detail about the process.
