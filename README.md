<!-- 
For my Phase one project I would like to create my own json file and use JSON-Server. 

The single page would use a HTML/CSS/JS frontend to accomplish a voting machine that allows users to pick their favorite color to paint a car. 

My three event listeners are going to be asynchronous data fetching for real time voting results. 

A mouse event onClick. 

And lastly, unloading DOM content once a vote is cast. 

I will use the filter my one instance of array iteration for the voter data
