<!-- 
For my Phase one project I would like to create my own json file and use JSON-Server. 

The single page web app uses a DOMContent loaded for the user experience. This disables everything until the HTML and deferred scripts have been completely parsed. This is how the MDN web docs describe DOMContent. This works perfect for my page because it displays five images.

The images are of cars that are different colors. Grey, Red, White, and Blue. The fifth car is a vinyl wrap. This distinction isn't necessary for the MVP but leaves the door open for further development of this idea. 

My other two event listeners are mouseover and mouse out. Using the css tag of filter. I have access to the variable that controls how the user sees the image. I defaulted the filter to use a 10px blur. This is the right amount to see that there is a car there but not give away what kind it is. The mouseover is set to none so that the car becomes clear. The mouseout reapplies the filter. 

Minimum Viable Product complete.
